This report contains market data for `r params$symbols`.  To make for something to plot, I suggest you pull 7 days worth of data.

```{r}
# Get data
stock_data_tbl <- tq_get(
        x    = params$symbols,
        from = today()-7, 
        to   = today()
    ) %>%
    select(symbol, date, adjusted)

kable(stock_data_tbl,caption="Last 7 days of market close")
```

```{r}
# Create plot with gain/loss
## you to do
```

```{r}
# save data 
# do you want to have a single running RDS file, or a file for every time this runs
# up to you to decide
```
